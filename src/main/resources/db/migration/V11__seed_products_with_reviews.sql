  'I"ve been steadily upgrading my monitor over the last several years, going from an ASUS VS247H-P in 2013, to a BenQ XL2730z 1440p@144Hz in 2015-ish, to this behemoth. And man, what a nice monitor. 21:9 monitors are really immersive when gaming, especially in a semi-competitive FPS like Battlefield or Destiny 2. The slight LED lighting is a nice touch, with a glow being cast on my wall when I game at night.',

  'So I will start off by saying I researched monitors for about a week, literally around 30+ hours. I originally bought the ASUS PG348Q. When I got the ASUS I was not very happy with it. The screen had bad backlight bleed and didnt look very sharp, the colors looked kinda washed out and the blacks were like a grayish color. I contacted Amazon and did a return on the Asus monitor. I then ordered this Dell Alienware AW3418DW and was hoping it would be awesome. The Asus was my first ever ultra wide, curved and 1440P. I was coming from a LG 4K 60hz monitor (32UK50T). The Asus curve is almost like looking at a regular flat monitor because the curve is 3800R and not very pronounced.',

  'I love the look of the monitor. Looks sleek. But what"s important is the picture quality. Lots of light bleed and really bad contrast. No gamma control. Any scene where you"re in the dark, you can see the light behind the screen and it"s more of a light grey instead of black. For the money they charge, I expected better. Not a terrible choice but not the best. The high refresh rate is great if you can push them. I have a 7700k oc to 4.9 and a water cooled 1080ti and newer AAA games hang around the 70-80 fps.',

  'I really wanted to like this monitor, especially for $800 on sale. I liked the look of the monitor and liked the LED ambient lighting on the case. It was heavy and solidly built. However after a couple of weeks I noticed a lot of flickering. Coming out of sleep it would blink at least 5-6 times. Booting up the same thing. In certain apps and games it began happening. I purchased an LG 34GK950F for one of my other PC"s and did not notice these problems. I swapped between PC"s and the AW3814DW did the same thing. I am going to troubleshoot a little more but I did speak to Amazon tech support who did not have any idea of how to fix it other than call Dell for a replacement (of a new monitor-Bad idea). He put me me on with regular support who said I should return it and agreed the blinking is not normal. By tomorrow if I can"t solve this I will return it as he suggested. Also the monitor seemed a little dull but the blinking is what is ruining it.',

  'I"ve seen many other reviews saying this monitor does not tilt, but it in fact does. I"m guessing people didn"t take a close enough look at the hinge mechanism in the base, which attaches to the main display and allows for backwards tilt of approximately 15 degrees. The monitor is very light, thin, has small bezels, and produces reasonably good colors. It doesn"t have a vesa mount, but I knew that before purchasing it, and wasn"t planning to mount it. For $89, it is a great value.',

  'I just got this monitor few days ago and setting up literally took a minute. Colors are so vibrant and bright. Darks are good and brights are rich. I work in a IT field and I’ve seen and used a lot of monitors, this is by far the best I’ve used till date. I’ve only used vga and it’s already better than using hdmi in most of the monitors. I can only imagine what it would be after using with an hdmi cable. Its a steal for the price I got.',

The options menu is very easy to navigate. I didn"t want to do this, but I had to dock a star as it lacked the ability to tilt. It"s at a permanent position so I"m gonna have to stack an extra book below to go the position I want. Otherwise, 10/10',

  'I ended up buying two of these so I can run dual-monitors (mounted on a vesa mount), primarily for productivity (mainly coding) and I"ll say that having this huge amount of screen real-estate is absolutely marvelous! I"m used to using standard 21.5-inch 1080p monitors at work which now feel incredibly cramped and small. The 2560x1440 resolution on these S3291Ds really allows me to use my IDE (tool for software development) to its full potential with everything being nice and spread out while offering plenty of space. The second monitor is great for secondary tasks, or for keeping a DBMS (for database management) in full view. There is so much horizontal space that I can easily keep a DBMS on one half of the monitor and something like an Excel workbook, email client, etc on the other half while keeping the IDE on my main. I love it.',

  'So how is the picture? At first glance, the picture looks good. As good as my older Dell U2412 monitor. The size is great for browsing, text, coding, spreadsheets. Videos looked bright and not washed out like other monitors out of the box. Is this better than my other Dell U2415 monitor? No. But it"s very good at what it does.',

  'So far this chair is excellent. Nice and thick cushion on the bottom and good back support. It only has height adjustment and is very basic, but it feels well made and it is comfortable. I switched from an executive chair that had the splitting fake leather (only 5 years old, not the best quality). I prefer a chair without arms so I can scoot up to the desk, and the mesh back is much more breathable. I use this AmazonBasics chair for programming and development. It"s not the kind of chair you want if you like to lean back and consume media on your computer, but for computer tasks it is great. I use a similar chair 8 hours a day at work, but it isn"t as good as this one. I may replace it with this chair as well.',

  'My parents decided to purchase an office chair for my husband and I. We are both in college and were desperate for a functional and inexpensive office chair. I did some searching and came upon this one. The reviews sold me! We have had this chair for a month. It took 10 minutes to put together, with the help of two kids under 5, and it is very comfortable. The wheels move with smooth fluidity, the chair cushion is very comfortable, and the back of the chair provides ample support. The seat height adjusts easily as well. I am pregnant with our third child and back support is what we were definitely lacking with our other chair. This one does the job! Don"t hesitate to get it. The green is beautiful, and it is a high quality chair with an excellent price range. I got a floor protector to go under it because it sits on wood floors.',

  'So I"ve owned this chair for about 3 weeks now and it"s been good to me. I gave the back cushion to my wife because I need all the surface space I can get on the chair.

  'Product Quality: I was amazed with the quality of the leather like material, nice and thick and just feels great (soft but tough)! The frame seems to be really solid. The chair base is actually aluminum which is really well made and not plastic like almost all the other gaming chairs I saw. The wheels roll well on my carpet and I personally think they look great! Overall I was very satisfied. This chair has tons of adjustment and allows you to tilt back as well as move just the seat back to a recline position.

  'This is my second M570. With my first, I encountered some of the glitchy problems with the ball tracking noted in other reviews and I used the solution of transferring the ball from my old wired version.

I popped the ball out, wiped the ball and socket and replaced the ball. I still had significant friction. I inspected the socket for any flak from the plating molding - none. I inserted the old ball and it works fine - freely flies across multiple monitors. The new ball may be slightly (mils) larger and is clearly defective.

  'One thing I"ve found very frustrating, however, is that the volume control knob is backwards. It"s designed as if it"s on a stereo, rather than as if it"s on a computer. Let me explain. Traditionally, stereo volume knobs are used by grasping the entire knob, and increase volume as you turn them clockwise. However, most computer volume knobs are designed to be used by scrolling the right edge of the wheel. In that configuration, a clockwise rotation is a scroll down/toward the user, and so it decreases (rather than increases) the volume.',

  'This is not only an absolutely fantastic SPLIT style keyboard, but also one of the best in terms of key/tactile feel I"ve ever owned. I"ve tried all the usual mechanical keyboards, blue & brown switches (way overrated IMO) along with the legendary buckling spring switches. Yes, this is a rubber dome keyboard, BUT, it feels to me anyhow like a quiet and lighter touch buckling spring keyboard (think IBM Model M) without all the racket a buckling spring or cherry blue switch (or even brown) keyboard can make. It has a nice tactile snap to the keys and sounds similar to a Topre keyboard (youtube it) and has a nice muffled "thock" type sound, no clacky-ness at all. Even the larger stabilized keys are mostly quiet, and the one or two that aren"t can be made quiet by adding a little white grease lube (search amzn for elite keyboards grease) to the metal stabilizer underneath the key after carefully removing it with a keycap puller or very carefully prying off.',

  'I previously had the Microsoft wireless ergonomic keyboard, and while I loved it"s lightweight design and softness of the keys, I did not love that the 10-key was separate from the actual keyboard and would just stop working half the time. I work from home and this was a HUGE frustration for me. I decided to go back to a more conventional keyboard in so far as it was all one piece and it was wired. After reviewing many products I came to this and ultimately decided to give it a go. So far it"s amazing. I enjoy the keys, the fact that everything is all in one place and I don"t have to worry about anything getting in the way of the wireless because it"s NOT wireless. It also has a long enough cord that I can have it on my keyboard slide out and it doesn"t pull or tug on anything. Another favorite thing of this keyboard is the sleep and volume control buttons at the top of the board. I"ve had these on previous keyboards and NONE of them have worked as well as this one.

  'Here I am two years and one month later with the headphones finally writing a review. I have loved these headphones for the two years I had them but a few things have made them worthy of their less than ideal three star rating and they all have to do with build quality. As far as sound goes, they are excellent. They have exceeded my expectations and have had me grabbing for them over my Audio Technica"s, Sennheiser"s, Sony"s, and numerous other in ear headphones. But alas I shall reach for them no longer. At one month outside of their guaranteed warranty date, the right ear cup has stopped producing sound all together. Why it has is a mystery to me as the headphones remain safe on their hook and are never worn more than 10 feet from my desk. Aside from the right ear cup ceasing to work, they also had a few other issues. Within the first year of owning them, the leather from the ear cups had come undone leaving the blue foam inside visible. The adjusters for bass control on the side became so stiff after a year that it felt like they were going to snap off. And as an added note, the adjusters really don"t seem to produce much of a difference in bass response or overall sound quality so I fail to see the point of them. Additionally, after about an hour of use, the pads make one"s ears increasingly hot to the point of discomfort.

  'They shipped quickly and are comfortable. Sound quality is good both with the bluetooth and with the headphone jack. I only gave 3 stars though because once charged, the bluetooth mode lasts less than an hour before getting all crackly and needing a new charge. So usually I don"t even bother with the bluetooth mode (which is why I got these) and just use the headphone jack. Wouldn"t buy again. Oh well.',

  'I bought these headphones at the beginning of March, so I"ve had them for almost a month. According to the product description, the headphones should come with one charging cable and one audio cable. When I received the headphones the next day, the box included 2 charging cords, but no audio cord. I almost packaged up the box and sent them back that same day, but I decided to try out the headphones before giving up on them entirely. What I found is as follows:',

  'really good headphones considering the quality. i’ve had them for a few months, but i am sad and confused to find them broken. the left ear muff completely just came off, and i can see how one would get it back onto it but i can’t reattach them. i love these headphones and will probably glue the muff back on so i can continue to use them, but the durability of these is pure crap. i haven’t had them for that long and they’re already broken. also when you turn them on there’s this loud lady that screams “bluetooth mode” and “connected” which shocks me every time i use them. they are pretty good all things considered, but i’m disappointed with the whole ear muff situation. not a bad review of these but if you’re looking for something super long term these might not be a good fit',

  'Product works decently as far as sound and noise cancellation and great battery life. However, the product mentions “Buy it now with 30 days no-question-asked return policy, 6 months maintenance period, 24-hour Customer-friendly Support Service.” I bought these less than 6 months ago and something internal has broken on the right ear piece (I can hear plastic rattling around when I run). When I try to contact customer service it says I am out of my service window (again, I bought these at the end of September so still a couple weeks from 6 months). The other thing I didn’t like is they would still hurt my ears after extended use and they would slide back on my head running and I constantly had to adjust them.',

  'great gaming table. Legs height is adjustable which makes it more comfortable. Cup holder and earphone hangers are great features. Playing games on that table is a real pleasure. Mouses on the table mat is pretty smooth.',

  'When I order the desk I was a little skeptical about the desk. And when I received it and unboxed it I realized that it was top notch and wayy higher quality than I expected. This desk literally blew me away with how easy it was to put together and how extremely stable it is. Even on carpet it’s extremely stable and sturdy. I 100% recommend this desk to anyone. If your in the market for a desk, LOOK NO FURTHER. And it was well worth the money. I cannot stress enough how roomy and spacey it is. Extremely happy with this purchase!',

  'This is a very good spacious and sturdy desk. I was actually very impressed with the quality of the parts when putting this together. The mouse mat feels like a high quality desk mat and using a damp cloth (per instructions) actually cleaned the dusk spots I got on it when i was putting everything together.',

  'I got this gaming desk as an upgrade to my workstation and it has everything that I need. The free mouse pad fits both my mouse and keyboard with a lot of extra room left. I also put my headphone on the hook and my drink in the cup holder all the time while working or gaming. I like to turn on the rgb lights at night time and it looks really cool.',

  'I have considered a sit-stand desk for about a year and now that I have one I wished I would have done it earlier. The Flexispot is very easy to lift or lower. I love that it locks at any level and is very smooth going up and down. I purchased a monitor stand to attach two monitors, that frees up space for books and papers that I need while I"m studying and preparing to teach. The keyboard area is deep enough for my 15" laptop to sit on so I actually have three monitors available. I"ve only had it for a month but have enjoyed the versatility of being able to stand for a while during the day. I feel awake and focused which helps me feel more productive.',

  'I love my sit stand desk! The only hard thing about it is actually remembering to stand up when I’m busy and focused. The desk itself was a cinch to assemble (took less than 5 minutes) and is a breeze to raise and lower.',

  'Also, keyboard tray is a bit narrow on the indented part, and I have a Microsoft Ergo Keyboard so it barely fits. Mouse pad would not fit on the tray (I use a gel mouse pad to reduce stress on wrist).',

  'Hate sitting at my desk all day, so this standing desk has been a dream. Really easy to assemble with clearly written instructions. It’s sturdy, but that makes it a bit heavy too. Tip to have someone help assemble if 50 lbs is too heavy for you to lift. I got the white color and it looks extremely clean on my desk. Fits my laptop, laptop stand and monitor with plenty of room left for notebooks, phones, etc. Adjusting the table is so simple and you have the ability to lock it at the height that’s perfect for you. With previous standing desks I used, I could only lock it in at their pre-set heights which wasn’t ideal for me. This airlift standing desk let’s me adjust to it to any height I want, so I can view my computer screens at my exact eye-level which is great for my neck and posture. Worth every penny!',

  'I love this table! I was looking for a rolling computer cart that I could use comfortably in front of my recliner (with the foot rest down, of course). This cart rolls right up to and under my chair and over my lap. The height adjustment is fairly easy. I got it into the position I needed and it will remain there. The table top is very sturdy and remains flat with no tilt adjustment available. That is just what I wanted. I have an all-in-one computer (it looks like a monitor but is heavier and has all the computer hardware built in) with a keyboard and mouse on my table and it feels as stable and secure as a regular table top but with the added convenience of being able to roll the computer out of sight when it is not being used. By the way, it rolls very easily on tile floors and on the rug. It is the best table of its kind that I have found and at an excellent price on Amazon,',

  'The product is perfect for those sitting at a desk or chair with their laptop. I"m sure it has other uses, but as a laptop stand it was excellent and extremely sturdy. It may or may not serve well for those in bed, but I suspect it would have to be used side saddle for "in-bed" users. I don"t allow electronics in my bedroom so I wouldn"t use it for that purpose.',

  'This is a pretty good laptop table considering the economical price. It was not too difficult to put together, and it looks very nice. I only have a few cautions. It is not as stable as I had hoped when placed on a carpeted surface; it is a little too easy for it to tip backward (away from you) if you accidentally bump it, such as while getting up or sitting down. Also, it is not wide enough to accommodate both a laptop and a mouse comfortably. You might wish to get a separate add-on platform for a mouse. Lastly, because the height adjusts with just a tension screw, if you lean on the table while typing (as I tend to do) it will sink down over time and you will need to keep raising it back up. But all in all, given the price, it"s a satisfactory item.',
